##Dear Jonathan,

It **has** been a long time since we have received any substantial information in
regards to the portfolio. We are now coming under significant pressure from our
investors to provide information in regards to the portfolio.

We appreciate that the the current macro climate makes it very difficult if not
impossible to make forecasts. However, we still need to properly understand the
current progress of the business plans, the use of capital calls and source of
distributions.

The last financial projections we received were in Q2 2018, the last update on
any of the assets were the Management Packs to the end of August 2018.

This makes it impossible for us to form any view as to the state and value of
the Maple SPVs financial interest (and due Consideration) in the projects and
communicate this effectively to the investors.


This is especially an issue on projects where the funds called to date are
approaching / exceeding the projected capital requirement as we have no
information to substantiate the capital calls.

Strathmore court is a good example of this where we are about to exceed the
projected capital amounts.I assume that the calls are in relation to the
planning application, which I gather from the planning portal was granted in
February 2019, a material event in relation to the value of the asset.


Please could your team provide the below information in order for us to properly
report the current state the projects and remaining financial interest to our
investors.

Information request:

- the latest Board approved budgets
- Management Packs (reports), including any financial accounts, produced since
 August 2018
- any draft budgets / reports that have been shared with shareholders
- any cashflows which have been produced and shared with any shareholders since
Q2 2018, it would be good to understand the actuals to date even if the forecasts are unavailable.


Kind regards,

Serge
